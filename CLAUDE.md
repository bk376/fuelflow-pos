# Gas Station POS System Project

## Project Overview
Building a modern Ruby2 POS system clone with enhanced UI/UX and gas station management simulator capabilities.

## Important Context
- **Current Date**: August 2025
- **Project Goal**: Create a modern alternative to legacy Ruby2 POS systems ($11,500-$16,000) with better UI/UX and training simulation features
- **Target Market**: Gas stations and convenience stores

## Research Completed
- Ruby2 POS system analysis (legacy pain points, pricing, technical limitations)
- Gas station operations workflow requirements
- Technical architecture and integration needs (fuel pumps, payment processors, compliance)
- Regulatory compliance requirements (PCI DSS 4.0, EPA, OSHA, tax reporting)
- Modern UI/UX improvement opportunities
- Simulator and gamification features for staff training

## Key Technical Requirements
- Microservices cloud-native architecture
- Real-time fuel pump control (up to 64 dispensers)
- PCI DSS 4.0 compliance with P2PE encryption
- Multi-processor payment integration
- ATG tank monitoring and inventory management
- Touch-optimized interface with voice UI and gesture control
- Multi-language support and accessibility compliance

## Next Steps
- Review gas station POS system screenshots
- Design system architecture
- Plan implementation phases
